    "**Objective:** We will computationally reproduce the key bioinformatic findings of the study \"Single-cell RNA-Seq analysis of molecular changes during radiation-induced skin injury: the involvement of Nur77\". By processing raw single-cell sequencing data from Rat (Time-series: Day 0, 7, 14, 28) and Human (Control vs. Irradiated) samples, we aim to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Master Quality Control & Normalization:* We will generate \"Pre- vs. Post-Processing\" PCA visualizations to empirically demonstrate how Normalization removes technical artifacts (like sequencing depth) and how Log-Transformation stabilizes variance, ensuring downstream analysis reflects true biological signals rather than technical noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Construct a Skin Atlas:* We will identify and annotate major cutaneous cell populations—specifically observing the radiation-induced depletion of Keratinocytes and the dynamic fluctuation of Fibroblasts and Endothelial cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Analyze Fibroblast Heterogeneity:* We will isolate the fibroblast lineage to perform sub-clustering and Trajectory Inference (Pseudotime), mapping the developmental transition of fibroblasts during the injury repair process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Validate Molecular Targets:* We will visualize the specific upregulation of the orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 (Nr4a1) within fibroblast subpopulations, confirming its role as a critical regulator of cellular radiosensitivity and apoptosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part 1: Setup and Environment Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the necessary libraries. We use Scanpy for the core analysis, Pandas/NumPy for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for plotting. We also define our directory structure to ensure our results are saved systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "*sc.set_figure_params:* This sets global defaults for plots. dpi=300 ensures high resolution suitable for academic journals. vector_friendly=True ensures that when we save as PDF/SVG, the text remains editable.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Path Management:* We use pathlib instead of standard strings. This makes the code robust, working seamlessly on both Windows (\\) and Mac/Linux (/) file systems."

    "\n",
    "This is the most critical section. We define a function process_basic that takes raw data and turns it into a clustered map.\n",
    "\n",
    "*1. QC (Quality Control):*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Mitochondrial Reads (pct_counts_mt):* When a cell undergoes apoptosis (cell death) or mechanical lysis, the cytoplasmic membrane breaks, and cytoplasmic RNA leaks out. However, mitochondria are double-membrane organelles, so their RNA stays trapped inside. Therefore, a cell with >15% mitochondrial reads is likely a \"soup\" of a broken cell and must be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Total Counts:* We utilized it to filter out technical artifacts, identifying counts below 800 as \"empty droplets\" (oil droplets lacking a cell) and counts exceeding 20,000 as \"doublets\" (two cells captured simultaneously). Furthermore, we enforced a minimum threshold for detected genes (n_genes_by_counts > 400), a critical step that removes low-quality cells with insufficient transcriptomic information while preserving rare but biologically relevant cell populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*2. Normalization (sc.pp.normalize_total):* Normalization is a critical preprocessing step designed to correct for technical artifacts related to sequencing depth. Since the total number of reads captured can vary significantly between cells due to technical efficiency rather than biology, raw counts are scaled to a fixed total (typically 10,000 counts per cell). This ensures that the observed differences in gene expression levels reflect true biological variation rather than mere sampling discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*3. Log Transformation (sc.pp.log1p):* Log transformation is employed to stabilize the variance of the dataset. Because gene expression data typically follows a power-law distribution—where a few genes are highly expressed while most are rare—it violates the assumptions of many statistical algorithms. Applying a natural logarithm (ln(x+1)) converts this skewed distribution into a format that approximates a normal distribution, making the data suitable for downstream statistical analysis like differential expression testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "*4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):* PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to manage the high-dimensional nature of single-cell data, which often contains over 20,000 genes. It mathematically compresses this vast feature space into a smaller set of \"Principal Components\" (typically the top 30-50) that capture the directions of maximum variance in the data. This process isolates the predominant biological signals, such as cell differentiation states or cell cycle phases, while effectively filtering out random technical noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "*5. BBKNN (Batch Balanced k-Nearest Neighbors):* BBKNN is a fast, graph-based integration algorithm designed to correct \"Batch Effects\" without altering the original gene expression data. It addresses the common issue where technical noise causes biologically identical cells from different batches (e.g., Rat vs. Human) to cluster separately rather than grouping by cell type. Unlike standard algorithms that simply find the closest neighbors, BBKNN enforces connectivity across batches by compelling every cell to identify a balanced number of neighbors from each experimental condition, thereby creating topological bridges between datasets. Crucially, unlike methods that mathematically modify gene counts and risk introducing biological artifacts, BBKNN preserves the integrity of the original data by only adjusting the Neighborhood Graph, allowing for successful dataset merging for UMAP visualization and clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "*6. Leiden Clustering (The Community Detection):*\n",
    "\n",
    "* *What is it?:* An improvement on the Louvain algorithm. It treats cells as nodes in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *How it works?:* It looks for areas in the graph where nodes are highly connected to each other but loosely connected to the rest of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Why Leiden?:* Older algorithms (Louvain) sometimes produced \"disconnected communities\" (a cluster that is actually two separate islands). Leiden mathematically guarantees that every cluster is a well-connected community.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Resolution: The \"knob\" you turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * *resolution=0.1:* Broad grouping (e.g., \"Immune Cells\" vs \"Stromal Cells\").\n",
    "\n",
    "  * *resolution=2.0:* Specific grouping (e.g., \"CD4+ T-Cells\" vs \"CD8+ T-Cells\")."
